Angular (1.6.x) Messenger service modules.

The application is also hosted at: http://chasbeen.frih.net/messenger/

An application demonstrating a messaging service. This service can easily be decoupled and integrated/enhanced for any system.

(1) Configure the $exceptionHandler object (Decorating native Angular objects example) so that you can have bespoke Exception handlers. With the option to show users when deemed necessary/useful.

(2) Good looking system generated help messages utilizing Angulars directives for easily plugging into web pages.

(3) Integrate the messaging service to replace "console.log" debugging during build time.

Using the immediately-invoked function expressions development pattern that is readily available (and/or easily implementable) this example provides a good example of decoupled components that can be integrated and used during product build or final systems.
